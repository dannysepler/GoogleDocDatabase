An Experiment

## I think that Google Docs are pretty special. 

#### They're simple. They're powerful. They smell good. 

This project is an experiment to see if and/or how they can be used as databases. If this pulls out well, I will be able to host projects through Github Pages (or Dropbox), and compensate for not having a database by using Google Docs/Spreadsheets as makeshift ones.
